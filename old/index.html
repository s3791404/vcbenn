								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/c1.png" style="width:360px;height:300px;" alt="me and birb"></p>
								<p>Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Victoria Benn, you can call me Vicky. I’m a first year Information Technology student studying at RMIT. My student number is s3791404, so you can reach me at s3791404@student.rmit.edu.au - not that anybody would, just meeting project quota.</p>

								<p>I have an interesting heritage made up by a mix of British, Kiwi and Samoan, but I’ve lived in Australia all my life, down around the Carrum area. Where I reside, it’s a fairly grassy and open area with an abundance of wildlife, predominantly native birds - which is great, because birds are my favourite animals! </p>

								<p>I attended Chelsea Primary and followed up with Patterson River Secondary College, where I completed my VCE in 2018. My two years of VCE consisted of English, Maths, History, Art, Studio Arts, Psychology and Law, my favourite subjects especially being English and Art! I do have a legitimate interest in technology; it just so happened that whenever I tried to enrol in such a class, it happened to clash with another.</p>

								<p>In my spare time I enjoy sleeping, hanging out with friends and drinking bubble tea (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ I also love playing and interacting with my two pet birds, whom I just adore to bits - Mojo the cockatiel, and Roly the budgie. They’re pretty cool, they keep me company while I study, and usually end up falling asleep on my keyboard.</p>

								<h2 class="major">My interest in IT</h2>
								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/cc3.png" style="width:275px;height:270px;" alt="me and birb"></p>
								<p>I’m really the first person in my family to become both interested and invested in technology. As it was something my parents themselves never had, I was surrounded by it while I was growing up in hopes of familiarising myself with it; the earliest piece of technology I can recall having was at the age of 6, with an old dial-up router that played the horrifying tone for every connection attempt. With no help available from my (still) technologically incapable parents, I was on my own in the endless world of possibilities - no aid, but no restrictions. The years spent tinkering with the system and surfing the web was a time of fascinating exploration for me; quickly learning that there was always more to learn behind the scenes, I became stuck on the idea of experimentation with various components that make up the systems of technology. I don’t have too much experience in any particular field or area at all, but I think I’ve dipped into enough to be able to grasp onto most concepts to be introduced further in my studies. </p>
								<p>There were honestly really only two factors that went into choosing to study at RMIT; neither of them overly amazing or dramatic, but realistic and quite simple: reputation and distance. Nearing the end of my VCE studies, among the words tossed around such as “Monash” and “Melbourne University” was “RMIT”. Having already built up a reputation for its teaching in technology, and being such a straightforward two-train trip to get there, I had vouched to study I.T at RMIT. </p>
								<p>Pinpointing exactly what I expect to learn during my time at university isn’t something simple, because I didn’t take this course to learn something specific - I took it because I simply want to expand my knowledge of technology, in whatever direction I can. Like my own personal experiences within I.T, there isn’t anything in particular I’m after, but rather exposure to multiple different things. If I’m willing to be as open as I am to surprise, maybe I’ll find something I’ll become attached to. Either way, what I think is important to keep in mind, is that my studies won’t just end at university. No matter what path I choose, I will constantly be learning throughout my career, as long as I continue to invest myself. So, in a roundabout way, during my studies I’m expecting to learn how to learn.</p>

								<h2 class="major">My ideal Job</h2>
								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/cc5.png" style="width:300px;height:300px;" alt="me and birb"></p>

								<p>My ideal job, as described, is located <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38556154?type=promoted&searchrequesttoken=63b1f0cd-9081-48f3-9e1b-376de4791dd0">here.</a> An image of the job can be found below.</p>

								<p>The job to be fulfilled itself is simple: it is a Help Desk & IT Support position, where my duties would include aiding the business customers with their queries, concerns and tasks.
									What makes this particular position appealing to me includes a number of things; accessibility, growth, and further opportunities for climbing the ladder. Being a relatively normal “help desk” position, there isn’t too much that would be going on in the beginning, as I have one and only one objective: to support everyday customers. As such, I believe this position would be relatively “realistic” to aim for, in terms of acquiring a first job post-degree. However, as with any position that would require customer care, I believe not only would I get the incredible chance to develop my customer care skills, but to work on further improving my own technical set of skills even more as I work alongside customers and coworkers to solve problems and overcome obstacles. Similarly, the job description itself hints at what kind of environment a potential worker should be expecting to come into;
								</p>

								<p><i>“At Hostopia we're a diverse and helpful team of people ranging from the die-hard tech-heads to the visionary creatives, and we don't mess around; we know where we're gonna play and how we're gonna win!”</i></p>

								<p>Going by the casual and almost playful language used within the “formal” job description, the nature of both the business and the job appears to be pleasant, fun, and definitely approachable - the perfect kind of starting position for an entry-level tech.</p>

								<p>The skills, qualifications and experience required for this position don’t seem to be very far-fetched, but they do range a bit in terms of what they actually are. A potential employee would be needing to boast some networking and server-related knowledge, particularly of  VPS systems (virtual private server) and database management systems, alongside “control panels”; specifically, web hosting control panels. Skills required on the side include knowledge of, and a fair amount of experience with Linux-based operating systems, notably within the administrating area. Needless to say, the potential employee would also have to be constantly refining their knowledge of the company itself, along with its platforms and operating mechanics. </p>

								<p>My current skills, qualifications and experiences don’t match up to this at all; at best, I know what the requirements refer to, I just hold no actual knowledge on the use and mechanics of them. In order to acquire the skills I’m going to need for this specific position, I’m going to really have to study all of the things I mentioned above in the qualifications needed area - VPS, servers, DBMS, DNS/SQL, cPanel, and use of Linux (administrating). Networking, servers and DBMS, I know for a fact will be covered by my degree (Bachelor of Info Tech). Use of Linux and administration tools within Linux will possibly be covered - if not, acquiring a Linux OS isn’t too much of a challenge, and anything you don’t know can pretty much always be covered on the internet, but self-learning this can possess challenges and risks in itself; I could incorrectly teach myself the needed material and further confuse myself. Bottom line, everything I need is pretty much covered by the degree I’m currently taking - anything else required can be learnt on the side.</p>

							  <h2 class="major">My Personal Profile</h2>

								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/cc6.png" style="width:480px;height:300px;" alt="me and birb"></p>

								<p>In order to explore my personal profile, I've taken three seperate tests: a free online Myers-Briggs style <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 Personalities test</a>, <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/creativity-quiz.htm">Mind Tool's Creativity Quiz</a> and <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles.shtml"> Education Planner's learning styles test</a>. </p>

								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/personalityTest.png" style="width:348px;height:469px;" alt="16personalities"></p>

								<p>Of the 16 personalities that exist, I have the “Mediator” personality (INFP, -A/-T). I am an idealist, working both for the better of things and for the peace of the team. I am a deeply creative and passionate individual who enjoys the beauty of self expression through subtleties and, although I may appear as quiet or shy on the surface, there is nothing I enjoy more than the opportunity for rich and meaningful communication, especially with those who are like-minded, and particularly one-on-one. I am easily outspoken, but my goal isn’t to be the loudest; I simply wish to follow my morale and act according to my principles, rather than to seek any sort of power or fame, which I would neither be knowledgeable or comfortable enough possessing. </p>

								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/creativityTest.PNG" style="width:550px;height:435px;" alt="creativityTest"></p>

								<p>Combined with this, the results of my creativity test only serve to ensure I am a competent and open-minded thinker; almost always able to find a way to navigate through tasks, adaptable enough to easily generate a number of solutions to many problems that may stand between myself and my goals, and strong-willed enough to see myself and my team through to our objective.</p>

								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/learningStyle.PNG" style="width:559px;height:205px;" alt="learning style"></p>

								<p>As claimed by my last test, my learning style results indicate I am slightly more inclined towards a visual approach to learning; this means I should try to visually organise and represent the information I'm trying to memorise. I should make full use of colours, shapes and styles within pictures, maps, graphs, charts, diagrams and cartoons; visual projects and presentations would be the most  ideal way for me to structure my work. </p>

								<p>Being a “Mediator”, this means that my preferred style of work is, unfortunately for me, alone, or within a tight-knit group of people I already know - my existing connections with others is something I should definitely take into account when forming a team. Accordingly, I will face the challenge of taking work personally - if something seems mindless or isn’t worth accomplishing in my mind, even if vital to the team project, it will be very, very hard for me to undertake; but, if I am allowed to freely express my creativity and desire for a project or work I can meaningfully connect to, I will have no trouble quickly becoming a hard and dedicated worker. I do not work well at all within a busy and high-stress environment; aligning with both my personality and my learning style, I do my best when studying within a quiet place, learning (and performing) to my full potential when studying alone. To maximise my efforts, focus and quality of work, I should be stationed within a team of people I have some kind of existing relation with. What I’d enjoy the most would be working on any artistic, visual aspect of a project; mundane, repetitive tasks would bore me, and ultimately destroy any satisfaction from such work - according to my personality type, lack of happiness will eventually lead to a deadweight-like lack of motivation to work, regardless of personal choice; which could end up being detrimental to the project. Forming a team, I should be very clear with what I’m interested in working on, and what I’m not.</p>

							<article id="project">
								<h2 class="major">My project idea</h2>
								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/cc4.png" style="width:190px;height:235px;" alt="me and birb"></p>

								<p><b><i>Overview</i></b></p>
								<p>My project idea is for a simple expenses tracker, which could be made as either a computer application, or a mobile phone app. The expenses tracker will be able to do just what its name implies - it will track your expenses for you, going by data that the user inputs. The user will be able to regularly store what they have bought, the amount they paid for it, tag it or categorise it, and possibly be able to rate how important it was that they purchase that item, and how worth it it was. Users may also create spendings or savings goals for themselves within the application.</p>

								<p><b><i>Motivation</i></b></p>
								<p>My motivation comes from my own POV, especially as a university student. Focusing on keeping a balance of studying, social life, family life and personal life, it can be incredibly easy to forget just how much money I end up spending on things, on a daily basis, and per overall week. I’m sure that maybe, if I had an application that gathered and displayed my whole expenses per week, I’d think a bit more on cutting down on what I buy, and possibly become smarter with my spending habits. If I feel this way, perhaps there are more students who feel like this too.</p>

								<p><b><i>Description of features:</i></b></p>
								<p><ins>Purchase list:</ins> the main purpose of the app; or, the main feature, is being able to input and save data on what you’ve bought. The user will be able to ‘add’ a new purchase and record data such as the name of what they’ve bought, the quantity of what they’ve bought, and the overall (or even individual) price. Optional additions should include the time and date of purchase, as the user may only enter data on something they’ve bought beforehand; otherwise, the application should automatically record these. After the input of data, the user should be able to categorise, or ‘tag’ what they’ve bought; perhaps there could be a system which matches the number of tags together and displays the most frequently purchased items for the user.</p>

								<p><ins>Rating of Worth Feature:</ins> This feature concerns the concept of prompting the user to look back on their purchases; specifically, the initial reason for the desire to purchase, the purpose of the purchase, and if that purpose was fulfilled with the purchase. The “Rate of Worth” feature serves to induce the user to consider these by asking the user to categorise, or rate, each purchase they’ve made within the past week on a scale from 1 to 5; 1 being ‘It wasn’t worth purchasing and I didn’t really need it’ and 5 being ‘It was definitely worth it and I needed it’. By stacking these up week by week (or even day by day), the application may be able to combine common keywords and low ratings to inform the user of purchases that they could consider dropping in order to save money.</p>

								<p><ins>Spending History & Comparison:</ins> The application will save a history of the user’s purchases and their recorded information (time, date, price, tags, rating, etc) and use it to display a day-by-day, and then week-by-week chart (or even graph) for comparison purposes. The purpose of this feature is to be able to aid the user in maintaining their spending habits; for example, if a user were to spend a certain amount within one week, and then spent less the next week, the application will give the user a congratulatory message for saving money; but if the user were to spend more, the application will give the user a tip to watch their spending. </p>

								<p><ins>Cute vector graphics:</ins> I don’t need statistics to prove that, in general, users enjoy simplified graphics. Combine this with a cute, aesthetically pleasing design, and even looking at something that exists only to blatantly point out your bad spending habits can turn into a treat. Pointing out how the application looks as a feature might seem like a waste, but there’s some psychology that goes into it; my app’s purpose is to record spending habits, and just the concept of that alone could be enough to easily turn away some users, especially those who are self-conscious of their spending. Thus, there has to be something to “soften the blow”; something to reward the user for using the application and confronting themselves. Minimalist design will work best for my application, and the colours should be warm and inviting to look at. </p>

								<p><ins>Widget feature:</ins> For even easier accessibility to the app and the features of it, I figured perhaps it’d be easiest if there were a widget feature for it. The seconds it may take for the user to tap on their menu, scroll through their applications, click on it, and wait for the application to start can, surprisingly, feel like a long wait (especially for phone users). The user could simply transfer a simplified, live and self-updating report of their total amount for the day available to spend, their total day’s spending, and their total week’s spending, to the front page of their phone. </p>

								<p><b><i>Tools and Technologies</i></b></p>
								<p>For the purpose of the development and creation of this application strictly for mobile users, such (beginner level) software could include: MIT app developer, Appery.io, Mobile Roadie, Appy Pie, AppMakr and AppMachine. These are all free to use, and contain some cloud-based creators; all of them sport drag-and-drop interfaces, which means ease of use and friendliness to those who have little to no coding knowledge. If the audience was expanded to include desktop users, a programming language such as C# or even Java would suffice to create the basic program.</p>

								<p><b><i>Skills Required</i></b></p>
								<p>I believe it’d be entirely possible to recreate the basic concept of my project using a half drag-and-drop method from the software mentioned above, and half own coding. It’d be very feasible to ‘find’ the skills and software; since everything I mentioned above is essentially freeware, all it’d really take to gain the skills required for my project would just be to become familiar with the software mentioned above, and some more basic concepts within programming. The only downside would be the time consideration; as I’ve never made an app before, I don’t know how long it’d actually take to get a grasp on what would really be needed for my project.</p>

								<p><b><i>Outcome</i></b></p>
								<p>I believe the most positive outcome from this would not only be reduced spending habits, but the increase of smarter spending habits, particularly ones that would leave users conscious and aware of their own spending habits. Hopefully this application would be able to provide a day-to-day, and week-by-week personal money tracker that will motivate and encourage its users to spend wiser, and save more money. Alternatively, the outcome of this project would mean a build and increase in my own skills as a developer; it could even be a project I could put on a resume.</p>
